*.txt   # ignore *.txt in the target directory
*/*.txt # ignore *.txt in subdirectories of the target directory
        # but not in subdirectories of subdirectories;
        # so a/b/c.txt would *not* be ignored

backups/   # ignore the backups folder, but not its contents
backups/** # ignore the contents of backups folder but not the folder itself
