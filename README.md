# dotfiles

My messy as hell dotfiles I've slapped together over the years.
Not usually very generic, tailored to my individual machines, so this really shouldn't be open source.
But I like a thing or two about it, so here we are!

Take what you like or throw tomatoes at what you don't.
There's plenty of popcorn to go around.

## Notable things

TODO. Hehe :slightly_smiling_face:

- `dadjoke` in `.zshrc`:
  - Gives you a random dadjoke every time you open a shell

```
