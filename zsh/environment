# LLVM
# To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib -Wl,-rpath,/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib"
# installed via `brew install llvm`
# This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
#   because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
#   Parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.
# If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"
# For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
#   LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib
#   CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/llvm/include
